This report summarizes the results of the figure directory, which integrates
upstream workflows like ChIP-seq and RNA-seq as well as the downstream figures
generated by those analyzed data.

Workflow details
================

The following figures plot the different jobs for this analysis and their
dependency structure.  It is useful for verifying that updates to a particular
job will correctly trigger downstream jobs.

RNA-seq jobs
------------

The following plot shows the jobs in the RNA-seq workflow and their interrelationships.
