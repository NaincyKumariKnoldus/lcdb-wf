  ## Size factors {.tabset}

  Ideally, all libraries were sequenced to identical depth, in which case all
  size factors would be 1.0. In practice, this is almost never the case due to
  the difficulties of accurately measuring low concentrations of cDNA. These size
  factor estimates are DESeq2's way of showing how sequencing depth varies across
  libraries. If some libraries are much higher or lower than
  1 then those libraries had dramatically different coverage and we should be
  careful about interpreting results.

  Size factors are calculated according to the median-ratio method (equation 5 of
  [Anders & Huber
  2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2010-11-10-r106)).

  These diagnostic plots show the size factors (as a ranked bar plot) and the
  relationship between the size factors and the total read count (as
  a scatterplot).

    estimates](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#dispersion-plot-and-fitting-alternatives)
    section of the DESeq2 vignette for details.

  colData: |
    This table lists the samples included in the dds object.

  outliers: |
    Are there any samples with many outliers? See the [approach to count
    outliers](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#approach-to-count-outliers)
    section of the DESeq2 vignette for details.

  sparsity: |
    This plot can be used to see if the majority of genes with high counts
    are coming from individual (or a small number of) samples.

# RESULT TABLE -----------------------------------------------------------------
# Help for the columns in the results summary table.
results_table: |
  - row names of the table are the long-format human-readable labels of
  each contrast
  - **name:** column is the short name used to generate filenames.
  - **up** and **down** are the numbers of up- and downregulated genes respectively.
  - **nonzero:** the number of genes with nonzero read counts
    out of the total number of annotated genes.
  - **alpha:** genes with an adjusted pvalue lower than this are considered
    significantly changed.
  - **lfcThreshold:** by default, the null hypothesis is that the log2 fold
    change of genes is not different from zero. In some circumstances, it is
    useful to use a different threshold, which will be reported here.
  - **outliers:** Cook's distance is used as a measure of how much a single
    sample is influencing the fitted coefficients for a gene. If that value
    is too high, the gene is marked as an outlier and the pvalue and adjusted
    pvalue will be set to NA. If there are many (hundreds to thousands) of
    outliers, this is an indication that a sample may be problematic. In this
    case, the dds diagnostics plots may help identify the culprit.
  - **low.counts:** How many genes were not even tested for differential
    expression because they had too low counts.
  - **dds:** The name of the DESeqDataSet object used for the contrast (see
    "other diagnostics" section above for details).
  - **design:** the design, using R syntax. Originally described by
    [Wilkinson
    1973](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346786?seq=2#metadata_info_tab_contents),
    but see the [section in R for Data
    Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/model-basics.html#formulas-and-model-families)
    as well.
  - **test:** The contrast performed using the design. Words in this column
    indicate the contrast was specified to DESeq2 using a 3-item character
    vector. Numbers (like `0,+1`) indicate a numeric contrast. In this case,
    check the design matrix tab in the diagnostics section for the
    corresponding dds object.

# RESULTS PLOTS ----------------------------------------------------------------
# Help for the tabbed results plots
results_plots:
  ma: |
    An **M-A plot** gives a good overview of the comparison. There is one dot per gene.
    It shows three dimensions: the normalized counts (baseMean, on a log10 scale,
    x-axis), the effect size (log2FoldChange, y-axis) and whether or not a gene was
    signficant (color). Note that baseMean should **not** be interpreted as
    "expression level", because the values are only normalized to library size, not
    transcript length. We can say that a gene with higher baseMean than another
    gene has more observed reads, but we cannot say whether that is because it has
    a longer transcript or because there are more transcripts.

  volcano: |
    A **volcano plot** shows fewer dimensions than an M-A plot (it does not show
    normalized counts) but it can be useful for looking at the relationship of
    adjusted p-value and log2FoldChange.

  pval_hist: |
    The **raw p-value distribution** helps us assess if the data met the
    assumptions of DESeq2. This [Variance Explained blog
    post](http://varianceexplained.org/statistics/interpreting-pvalue-histogram/)
    has a good explanation of intepretation. Additionally, we color the p-values
    for genes that have been removed from independent filtering due to having too
    low counts.

    See the DESeq2 vignette on [independent filtering and multiple
    testing](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#independent-filtering-and-multiple-testing)

  filter_ma:
    This MA plot colors genes by whether or not they were filtered out in the
    independent filtering step.</details>

  outlier_ma:
    This MA plots colors genes by whether or not they were considered an outlier.

  lfcse_basemean:
    This plots the standard error of the log2FoldChange vs baseMean. In
    general, as baseMean increases the lfcSE decreases.

  lfcse_lfc:
    Standard error of the log2FoldChange vs the log2FoldChange itself.
